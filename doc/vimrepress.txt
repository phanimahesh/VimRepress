INSTALL                                               *vimrepress-install*

Download VimRepress and extract it in your .vim directory:
>
         cd ~/.vim
         unzip /path/to/VimRepress*
<

Or, if you're using pathogen.vim to manage your plugins:
>
         cd ~/.vim/bundle
         git clone git://github.com/vim-scripts/VimRepress
<

If you need Markdown support in Ubuntu, simply run 
>
         sudo apt-get install python-markdown
<

If you use other distributions (or OSes), refer to your package manager or 
the python-markdown project page: 
http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Installation

CONFIGURE                                             *vimrepress-config*

Edit ~/.vimrc , add a variable named VIMREPRESS. 
Multiple blog configurations are supported.

Example:~
>
         let VIMREPRESS = [{'username':'user',
                         \'password':'pass',
                         \'blog_url':'http://your-first-blog.com/'
                         \},
                         \{'username':'user',
                         \'blog_url':'http://your-second-blog.com/'
                         \}]
<
Hardcoding the password is optional. If a password is not provided the 
plugin will prompt for one the first time it's needed.

                                                      *g:vimrepress_tags_completable*

Wordpress categories are enabled for <C-x><C-u> autocompletion by default. If
you wish to enable tag autocompletion as well you can set this variable to
'true' in your ~/.vimrc. This may make the plugin load more slowly.

         let g:vimrepress_tags_completable = 'true'

TIPS                                                  *vimrepress-tips*

                                                      *vimrepress-cat*
Categories~

When you're writing a new post and you want to add a category to the meta data, 
press <CTRL-X><CTRL-U> in |Insert-mode| for category autocompletion using
'completefunc'. See |compl-function| for more information.

                                                      *vimrepress-recover*
Recovery~

If you have a slow connection to your blog, there's a chance that gvim will hang
while attempting to save. Generally this will resolve itself if you wait, but if
vim crashes and fails to save, you can recover your post with the Vim's
recovery options. See |recovery| for more information.
